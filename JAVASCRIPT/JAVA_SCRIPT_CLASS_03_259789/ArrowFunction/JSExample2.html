<!--You are driving a little too fast and police stops you.Write a code to compute the result,encoded as an int value:0no ticket,1small ticket,2bigticket.If the speed is 60 or less,the result is 0.If the speed is in b/w 61-80 the result is 1,if the speed is >81,the result is 2.Unless it is your b’day on that day,your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.-->
